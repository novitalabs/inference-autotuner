Update development diary from recent conversations.

1. Append entry to today's diary file: `agentlog/yyyy/mmdd.md`
2. Follow the format:
   - Don't use date-based section headers, the diary file name has already indicated the date
   - Include user's prompt and agent's response
   - Agent's response should be enclosed in foldable `<details>` block
   - Summarize concisely if original text is too redundant
   - Fix typos in prompt text if present
3. Create the diary file if it doesn't exist for today
4. Use `---` separator between multiple entries on the same day
5. Write in English always, translate if necessary

Note: The file is directly written to `agentlog/yyyy/mmdd.md` based on today's date.
